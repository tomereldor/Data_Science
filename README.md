# Data_Science
This folder consists of project made for:
1. Data Science and Impact Evaluation - Making Infromation Based Decisions, Course CS112 (R)
2. Various Personal Data Science realated projects in R and python. 
3. Modeling and Simulation for Decision Making - Course CS166 (Python Models and Simulations, in iPython notebooks)

I'd recommend looking at:
- CS166 Final (it was too heavy so you'd need to download it). Same for "Social Dynamics and Personal Parameters".
- Does_Obesity_Impact_Wages__Overweight_and_Overburdened/Does Obesity Really Reduce Wage - Final.pdf
- NYC Taxi Analysis (PDF Report)
