# Data_Science
This folder consists of project made for:
1. Data Science and Impact Evaluation - Making Infromation Based Decisions, Course CS112 (R)
2. Various Personal Data Science realated projects in R and python. 
3. Modeling and Simulation for Decision Making - Course CS166 (Python Models and Simulations, in iPython notebooks)

I'd recommend looking at:
- CS166 Final (it was too heavy so you'd need to download it)
- CS112 Final: Does Obesity Increase Weight?
- NYC Taxi Report
